# GameEngine

# Description
GameEngine is a game and application development environment written in the C++ programming language. GameEngine provides basic functionality for working with 2D graphics based on OpenGL, as well as individual controls.

# Startup Requirements
Operating system: Windows 10+, Linux, or macOS
C++ compiler with C++11 support (MinGW-GCC, MSVC, Clang)
Libraries (pre-installed in the vendor folder): OpenGL 3.3+, GLFW 3.3+, GLAD, GLM, STB Image

# Usage
To create a new game based on GameEngine:
    1. Copy the project structure
    2. Use the basic classes:
        Game - the main game class
        GameObject - the basic game object class
        SpriteRenderer - the sprite rendering system
        ResourceManager - the resource manager
        Area2D - the 2D collider system
